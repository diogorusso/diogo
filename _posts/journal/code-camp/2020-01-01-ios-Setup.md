intro:
  In this video case study, the Ticketmaster design team shares how Framer X
  has streamlined their processes and simplified collaboration.
details:
  For designers, code can be intimidating—it requires a lot of time and effort
  to learn. However, learning how to code in React can be a really powerful tool for
  designers because it allows you to build complex, interactive elements. In this
  post, we’ll be exploring the benefits of highly interactive prototypes and how to
  build a simple interactive code component with React in Framer X.
